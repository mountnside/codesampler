To build Lua 5.1.2 for Windows using Visual Studio .NET 2003, simply copy the 
folder "vc71_build" to the root or main folder of the Lua source code 
directory.

For example, if you unzip "lua-5.0.2.tar.gz" and it creates a folder called 
"lua-5.1.2", copy the folder "vc71_build" into it.

Then, load the workspace or solution file and build.

As you can tell, I tested this build environment against Lua 5.1.2, which I 
downloaded from here:

http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.1.2.tar.gz

Once the build has completed, you should find two new directories in the root 
or main folder of the Lua source code directory called, "bin" and "lib".

I hope it helps!
